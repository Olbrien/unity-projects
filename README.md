# Projects

These are Unity projects I've made to practice different skills.

To note every video recorded and gif made have incredible low quality. My computer isn't the best, can't record with decent FPS and colors.\
The videos have better quality but they are still very low quality.

# Imperial Poly

I made this project to learn how to create a 3D environment.\
Used post-processing.\
Built every low-poly object by myself using Blender.

# Udemy RPG 

This is from a tutorial made by GameDev.tv on Udemy.com.\
It was a good introduction to cinematics.

Again quality of the video is really bad can't record with decent FPS and the colors are really bad as well.

# Online Chat

This is a project I made for a friend that wanted to do an horror short-movie (curta metragem).\
You have two applications, one on your computer and one on your android.\
Both connect to the same IP.\
Both communicate with eachother. You can message from your phone and it appears on your computer, vice-versa, phone on phone, or pc on pc.\
Handles multiple clients.

# Imperial Undertale

The reason I wanted to learn Unity was because I enjoyed Undertale so much.\
My first project was making a similar fighting style.\
It evolved into having an actually story and different approach but unfortunately I never finished it.\
It was a good first project to learn Unity.

It has working movement, enemy, HP / Shield and mechanics.
